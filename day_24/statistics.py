# Day 24: 30 Days of Python Programming

# To summarize, the main differences with python lists are:
#   Arrays support vectorized operations, while lists donâ€™t.
#   Once an array is created, you cannot change its size. You will have to create a new array or overwrite the existing one.
#   Every array has one and only one dtype. All items in it should be of that dtype.
#   An equivalent numpy array occupies much less space than a python list of lists.
#   numpy arrays support boolean indexing.
